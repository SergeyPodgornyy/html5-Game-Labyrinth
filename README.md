How to find game page?
----------------------

Your game located in folder *labyrinth*. For starting the game, type on your address bar the following path:
```
http://localhost/labyrinth/labyrinth.html
```

###Note!
You need installed Python on your computer

###For Developers
Once you have Limejs installed you only need to run the following command to create a new game:
```
bin/lime.py create labyrinth
```
Just tell it to create the game and give it a name. It will create an HTML file and a JavaScript file in the folders where you need it to run.


When Frog object was created I run the following script of Lime to get Google Closure to update all of dependencies:
```
bin/lime.py update
```
